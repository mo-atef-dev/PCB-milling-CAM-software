Each version is named according to the date work has started on it (right after the commit of the previous version).

-- Version 2022.5.9

Changes:
-Fixed a critical mistake in outputting the compressed 4 bytes command (the byte containing the configurations was placed as the fourth byte but it was correctly fixed to be the first byte).

-- Version 2022.5.10

Changes:
-Fixed a mistake where the Window Procedure function of the drawing window was set the layer's window.
-Fixed a mistake where the Window creation function of the drawing window set the ID of the created window to the layer's window ID.
-Added button common control.
-Added text manipulation function to most common controls.
-Fixed an error where the output compressed commands were only 1/4 of the actual number of commands
-Added initial implementation to separating the mmg and cmd generation code to different reusable functions

-- Version 2022.5.16

Changes:
-Same as previous

-- Version 2022.6.28

Suggestions:
- Make outBuff (the array of bytes storing the output commands) global to allow separating command generation from downloading

Changes:
- Added a feature to allow downloading an open commands file
- Added the ability to open a command file
- When a command file is generated in a session, it is automatically set as the command file for downloading
- Added usb.cpp and usb.h from Ahmed Abdulazeem for USB downloading feature
- Added forgotten (return r) statements to the end of each App_Open function

-- Version 2022.7.4

Changes:
- Added maxCupper_loading header and source files from Joseph and adapted the project to them, but haven't added the new drawing features correctly yet.
- mmPerStep is set to 0.02
- Started migration to stepPermm instead of mmPerStep
- Replaced Kerolos cmd.cpp with a stripped down version (not including acceleration) because the original one was bugged
- Added default values to max copper dialog
- Fixed a bug where output commands are generated wrong when they are generated from gerber files

-- Version 2022.7.8

Changes:
- (Tracebmp) Fixed radial scan function to account for negative coordinates
- (Tracebmp) Fixed mistakes in calculation in TraceStart function
- Added missing file handle closing in both download and App general file open function
- (Tracebmp) Added clearance function
- (Tracebmp) Added a "return to origin" command as the final command

-- Version 2022.7.10

Changes:
- Refactored code in max copper menu command by replacing common code with function calls
- Added Joseph updates for max copper and drawing module
- Replaced cmds.cpp with latest implementation by Kerolos (note that this needed a change in the header file to use the function that requires float inputs, and a change in app.cpp in MMGtoCMDs function to input mmPerStep instead of stepPermm)

-- Version 2022.7.15

Changes:
- All debug messages in tracebmp.cpp file are enclosed in #if defined(DEBUG) directive to allow easy removal and insersion of debug messages
- Added a feature to mark pixels which have been visited twice by the tool as green
- Added latest team mates files
- Removed GUI buttons
- Removed unused menu items
- Added the ability to open an MMG file and a menu item to convert the MMG to commands, using the mmgparse module by Kerolos
- Output file paths are now strict as following:
 -- For max copper the output is in the same directory as the copper layer
 -- For MMG conversion to commands, the output is in the same directory as the source MMG
 -- For MMG and commands generation from an image, the output is in the same directory as the source image
- Adjusted the release build settings

-- Version 2022.7.17

Changes:
- Added latest team mates files
- Added the ability to draw MMG toolpaths
- Added the ability to select max speed
- Removed the ability to determine the machine resolution and is not fixed at 0.1mm per pixel
- Fixed a bug where the program crashes when the user cancels mmg open file dialog
