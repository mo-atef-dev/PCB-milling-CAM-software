# PCB-milling-CAM-software
Software that aids in manufacturing PCB boards on milling machines. It is part of a graduation project about building a complete CNC PCB milling machine.

The project is a bit old and it has many flaws and mistakes in styling, formatting, and organization. There are a lot of things we would change if we redid it. However, it is still a working software and a big accomplishment.

Uses: Win 32 API, C++, Direct2D, WIC (Windows Imaging Components)
